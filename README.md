# Python_project
Built a hangman game using important python concepts like loops, conditional statements

Dynamic Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
User Interaction: Players input guesses and receive feedback in real time.
Error Handling: Tracks invalid inputs and ensures smooth gameplay.
Code Structure: Organized and beginner-friendly implementation using loops and conditionals.
Key Learnings:
How to use while loops and if-else statements effectively.
Basics of user input handling and validation.
Implementing game logic and state tracking.
Future Enhancements (Optional):
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
Implement different difficulty levels.
Enhance the word bank by integrating an external API for word selection.
